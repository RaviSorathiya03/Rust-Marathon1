# Rust-Marathon1 ðŸ¦€

Welcome to **Rust-Marathon1** â€“ my personal journey into learning the Rust programming language!

## ðŸš€ About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I learn Rust. I'll be uploading exercises, mini-projects, notes, and key learnings here as I go through tutorials, books, and real-world practice.

### âœ… Current Status

I'm currently in the learning phase of Rust, focusing on:

- Understanding the basics of the language
- Writing small programs to reinforce concepts
- Exploring Rustâ€™s ownership model, memory safety, and error handling
- Experimenting with common patterns like enums, traits, and pattern matching

## ðŸ“š Learning Resources

I'm currently learning Rust through:

- [The Rust Programming Language Book (a.k.a. The Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- YouTube tutorials and crash courses
- Real code experimentation
